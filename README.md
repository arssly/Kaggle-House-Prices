# Kaggle-House-Prices

Here I play around with [kaggle House Prizes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 
First, I do some preprocessing: detect and remove outliers, Normalize data distribution, Fill missing data, etc.
then, I play with different Scikit-learn regression models to see which one works best and why? 
Finally, I try different voting methods to create an ensemble out of the previously mentioned models.
